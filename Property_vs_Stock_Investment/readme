I hear a lot of times about folks investing in a rental property.
So as an exercise in curiousity, I decided to simulate the money that can be made by investing in the stock market, versus investing in a rental property.

The assumptions are stated throughout the notebook. Some of the conclusions are summarized below
- At a historic return rate of 9.8% for S&P 500, investment in stocks will lead to a 18% gain over rental property over 30 years
- Stocks are more liquid than a property. 
- However, this does not give the satisfaction of owning a tangible property.
